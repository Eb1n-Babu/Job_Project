Job Project
Overview
Job Project is a Django-based web application designed to manage job-related data, such as job postings, applications, or candidate information. Built with a standard Django project layout, it provides a robust foundation for storing, retrieving, and manipulating job-related information through a web interface.
Features

CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete job-related data using Django's ORM.
Web Interface: User-friendly interface built with Django templates for seamless interaction.
Admin Panel: Manage data efficiently via Django's built-in admin interface.
Static Assets: Supports CSS, JavaScript, and images for enhanced user experience.
Database: Uses SQLite by default for simplicity during development.
Modular Design: Organized into apps (e.g., job_app) for scalability and maintainability

its in developing state so future it will updated

Usage

Web Interface:

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.
Navigate to app-specific endpoints (e.g., /jobs/ for job listings).


Admin Panel:

Access http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with superuser credentials.
Manage job data through an intuitive interface.



Configuration

Database Setup: SQLite is used by default. To switch to another database (e.g., PostgreSQL), modify settings.py:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}


Static Files: For production, collect static files with:
python manage.py collectstatic



Dependencies
